# Style & Conventions
- File headers: every code file starts with a 2-line ABOUTME: comment describing purpose.
- Changes: keep minimal, match surrounding style, never rewrite without permission.
- Comments: preserve existing comments unless provably false; write evergreen comments (no temporal refs).
- Naming: avoid “new/improved/enhanced” names; use evergreen names.
- Python: PEP 8, type hints, prefer pathlib over os.path.
- Shell: use /usr/bin/env shebangs, quote variables, check exit codes.
- PowerShell: approved verbs, try/catch error handling.
- Testing: never add mocks; use real data/APIs only.
- Commits: conventional commit format; never use --no-verify.
- Git: prefer gh CLI; use git only if necessary.
