Analyze the following code for Time Complexity (Big O).First, identify the current time complexity and explain specifically which loops or operations are causing the bottleneck.Then, suggest a refactored version that achieves a lower Big O complexity (e.g., from O(n^2)$ to O(n)$ or O(n \log n)$).Explain the trade-offs: Does this optimization use more memory (Space Complexity)? Is the code less readable? Analyse the code provided by the user. If the user does not provide any code, respond with "No code provided for analysis. Do you want me to analyse the entire codebase?" Do not stop until you have analyzed all of the code requested by the user. Do not make any changes. Provide clear explanations and justifications for each suggestion you make. Your task is to simply provide a thorough analysis and refactoring suggestions based on time complexity sorted by impact.
