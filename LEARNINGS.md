- Context: Fix invalid YAML warnings for SKILL.md frontmatter
  What I tried: Inspected SKILL.md frontmatter; converted long description values to block scalars
  Outcome: Worked; YAML parser no longer treats "Triggers on:" as a mapping delimiter
  Next time: Quote or use block scalars for descriptions containing colons
- Context: Merge frontend-developer guidance into design-engineering
  What I tried: Extracted unique guidance into a new aesthetic-direction reference and linked it from design-engineering
  Outcome: Worked; overlap consolidated and skill archived
  Next time: Check for conflicts with existing design-engineering motion and marketing constraints
