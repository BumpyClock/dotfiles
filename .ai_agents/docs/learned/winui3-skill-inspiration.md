# WinUI 3 skill inspiration search (2026-02-18)

## Sources
- https://playbooks.com/skill/windows-app-developer-skill

## Findings
- Few public WinUI 3-specific skill templates exist. The Playbooks skill uses a clear structure: scope/when to use, workflow steps, and a reference index. It keeps the main skill concise and pushes details into references.

## Applied
- Added a Scope section and a Reference Index to the WinUI 3 skill to mirror the concise, navigable structure.
