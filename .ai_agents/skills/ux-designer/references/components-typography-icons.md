# Components, Type, and Icons

Read when: you need guidance for controls, typography scales, data presentation, or icon usage.

## Isolated Controls
- Treat pickers, filters, and dropdowns as crafted objects, not plain text.
- Avoid native form controls for styled UI (select, date input). Use custom triggers and popovers instead.
- For custom select triggers, use inline-flex and no-wrap text to keep label and chevron on one line.

## Typography Hierarchy
- Headlines: 600 weight, tight tracking (-0.02em).
- Body: 400 to 500 weight, normal tracking.
- Labels: 500 weight, slight positive tracking for uppercase.
- Scale: 11, 12, 13, 14 (base), 16, 18, 24, 32 px.

## Monospace for Data
- Use monospace for numbers, IDs, codes, and timestamps.
- Use tabular-nums for column alignment.

## Iconography
- Use Phosphor Icons when an icon adds meaning.
- Remove decorative icons that add no semantic value.
- Give standalone icons subtle containers so they feel intentional.
