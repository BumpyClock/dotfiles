# Design Direction

Read when: you need to choose or revise the overall aesthetic direction for a product or feature.

## Context Questions
- What does the product do?
- Who uses it?
- What is the emotional job (trust, efficiency, delight, focus)?
- What would make it memorable?

## Personality Options
- Precision and density: tight spacing, monochrome, information-forward. Good for power users. Examples: Linear, Raycast, terminal aesthetics.
- Warmth and approachability: generous spacing, soft shadows, friendly colors. Good for collaborative tools. Examples: Notion, Coda.
- Sophistication and trust: cool tones, layered depth, financial gravitas. Good for money or sensitive data. Examples: Stripe, Mercury.
- Boldness and clarity: high contrast, dramatic negative space, confident type. Good for decisive modern products. Examples: Vercel, minimal dashboards.
- Utility and function: muted palette, functional density, clear hierarchy. Good for developer tools. Example: GitHub.
- Data and analysis: chart-optimized, technical but accessible, numbers as first-class citizens.

Pick one or blend two, but commit to a direction that fits the product.

## Color Foundation
**Don't default to warm neutrals.** Consider the product:

- **Warm foundations** (creams, warm grays) — approachable, comfortable, human
- **Cool foundations** (slate, blue-gray) — professional, trustworthy, serious
- **Pure neutrals** (true grays, black/white) — minimal, bold, technical
- **Tinted foundations** (slight color cast) — distinctive, memorable, branded

**Light or dark?** Dark modes aren't just light modes inverted. Dark feels technical, focused, premium. Light feels open, approachable, clean. Choose based on context.

**Accent color** — Pick ONE that means something. Blue for trust. Green for growth. Orange for energy. Violet for creativity. Don't just reach for the same accent every time.

### Choose a Layout Approach

The content should drive the layout:

- **Dense grids** for information-heavy interfaces where users scan and compare
- **Generous spacing** for focused tasks where users need to concentrate
- **Sidebar navigation** for multi-section apps with many destinations
- **Top navigation** for simpler tools with fewer sections
- **Split panels** for list-detail patterns where context matters
- **Full-screen layouts** for immersive experiences where users need to focus
- **Responsive layouts** for adaptable experiences across devices
- **Floating panels** for contextual actions or additional information

### Choose Typography

Typography sets tone. Don't always default:

- **System fonts** — fast, native, invisible (good for utility-focused products)
- **Geometric sans** (Geist, Inter) — modern, clean, technical
- **Humanist sans** (SF Pro, Satoshi) — warmer, more approachable
- **Monospace influence** — technical, developer-focused, data-heavy
