# Community Toolkit

Use when adding Windows Community Toolkit controls/helpers or MVVM Toolkit.

Windows Community Toolkit (WinUI 3)
- Repo: https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Windows
- Use `CommunityToolkit.WinUI.*` packages for Windows App SDK / WinUI 3.
- Use `https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-Windows` for additional components.
- Install only needed packages via NuGet.
- Use Toolkit Gallery to preview controls.

MVVM Toolkit
- Package: `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`
- Use for `ObservableObject`, `RelayCommand`, `AsyncRelayCommand`, `IMessenger`, `Ioc`.
- UI framework agnostic; ok for WinUI 3.
