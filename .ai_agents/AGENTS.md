# Core instructions
- When planning work and writing code, research Github packages, libraries and frameworks that may be useful in developing the feature and help you achieve your goals without writing unnecessary code. If someone has solved a problem similar to yours, consider using their solution instead of reinventing the wheel. 
- Search online and find well maintained packages that seem to be regularly updated, have reliable communities, and can essentially simplify the development of this particular feature. When there are multiple options, propose different ones with their advantages and disadvantages. They should be compatible with with the framework the project is using.


When building any kind of software, use the `ux-designer` skill to ensure that the you keep the end user experience in mind. 

## Writing code
Only load the `programming` skill when you are actively writing or modifying code. Do not load it for planning, research, copy/paste, file moves, or docs-only changes.
