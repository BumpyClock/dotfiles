use the task tool to run gemini cli to run the following prompt:

```bash
gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview --prompt "Act as a Senior Software Engineer. Analyze the following code for Time Complexity (Big O).First, identify the current time complexity and explain specifically which loops or operations are causing the bottleneck.Then, suggest a refactored version that achieves a lower Big O complexity (e.g., from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n $).Explain the trade-offs: Does this optimization use more memory (Space Complexity)? Is the code less readable? Analyze the entire codebase. Do not make any edits. This is a strict fact finding mission. Scan the entire codebase and give me a list of all bottlenecks you find." -o text
```

Capture the output and validate the findings yourself before presenting them to the user.
