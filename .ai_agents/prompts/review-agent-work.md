agent reports that it's done. Please review it's work, don't just review that the task is done, ensure that it is done well and if the agent implemented the optimal solution. If the task is well done, mark it done in the tasklist. If not then create a follow up prompt for the coding agent to implement the fixes.

# PROMPT CREATION FLOW

- You are the expert and decision maker along with the user and you are creating a detailed and precise prompts for coding agents to implement the fixes you identify in the review of the completed task.
- The coding agent is not great at making decisions so tasks should not leave it up to the coding agent to make decisions. **YOU MUST** make any decisions needed and be explicit in the prompt you provide. If needed discuss with me and clarify any uncertainties before finalizing the prompt and making decisions.
- Read any needed and relevant code so you can make any decisions needed for the implementation so that the coding agent can implement the task successfully.
- The prompt should be very detailed and precise so that the coding agent can implement the task without any further clarifications.
- If the task is too big to be done in one go then break it down into smaller sub tasks and create a prompt for each sub task following the same rules as above.
