# Fluent Design and WinUI Guidance

Use when refining visual polish or aligning UX with Windows design guidance.

## Design hub essentials
- Start from the Windows design hub for layout, navigation, input, typography, and motion guidance.
- Aim for consistency across devices, input types, and form factors.

## Windows 11 design principles
- Effortless: reduce steps for common tasks and make primary actions easy to find.
- Calm: limit visual noise and emphasize only what matters.
- Personal: respect user settings (theme, contrast, text size) and allow customization.
- Familiar: prefer standard WinUI controls and patterns unless you have a strong reason not to.
- Complete + coherent: maintain consistent spacing, typography, and motion so the UI feels unified.

## Signature experiences checklist
- Color: use color to indicate hierarchy and draw attention only when necessary.
- Elevation and layering: use depth to show hierarchy and relationship between surfaces.
- Iconography: use clear, familiar symbols to aid recognition and scanning.
- Materials: use Mica/Acrylic to connect the app to its environment.
- Geometry: keep shapes and layout consistent to reduce cognitive load.
- Typography: use type hierarchy to improve readability and scannability.
- Motion: keep motion reactive and context-aware to reinforce way-finding.

## WinUI-specific guidance
- WinUI is a modern native UI framework that brings Fluent Design, high-performance rendering, and a XAML programming model to C# and C++.
- Prefer WinUI controls and styles to stay aligned with Fluent defaults and accessibility behavior.
