name: figma
description: Generate or update UI components from Figma designs using Figma MCP. Use when a task requires extracting layout, colors, typography, or spacing from Figma, reusing design tokens and existing styles, and validating the result in the browser with Playwright.
---

Implement components that match Figma designs precisely. Use Figma MCP and Playwright MCP to drive the workflow. Follow the project's coding instructions and avoid inventing new styles when existing ones apply.

## Subskills

Read these when the task matches and to use the Figma MCP server effectively:

- [implement-design/SKILL.md](implement-design/SKILL.md): Use for end-to-end Figma-to-code implementation with 1:1 visual parity.
- [code-connect-components/SKILL.md](code-connect-components/SKILL.md): Use for mapping Figma components to existing code components via Code Connect.
- [create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md](create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md): Use for generating project-specific Figma/design-system rules (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or Cursor rules).
