**TASK IMPLEMENTATION SUB-AGENT ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW**

Think deeply about this sophisticated parallel implementation strategy. You are about to orchestrate a multi-agent implementation system that transforms architectural blueprints into living code through coordinated parallel execution. Use the bash tool to launch multiple parallel instances of claude-code for implementation with 15-minute timeout for complex operations. All agents operate within the same branch sanctuary unless explicitly directed otherwise. **Ultrathink.**

**Variables:**

tasklist_file: $ARGUMENTS 
phase: $ARGUMENTS
tasks: $ARGUMENTS
branch: $ARGUMENTS
testing: $ARGUMENTS
test_command: $ARGUMENTS
journal: $ARGUMENTS
build: $ARGUMENTS

**PHASE 1: COMMAND RECONNAISSANCE & PARSING**

**Command Structure Analysis:**
```
implement {phase/tasks} from {tasklist_file} -- {arguments}
```

**ARGUMENTS ORCHESTRATION:**
Parse and deeply understand the following implementation parameters from "$ARGUMENTS":

1. **`tasklist`** - Sacred blueprint containing the implementation roadmap (default: .claude/tasks/tasks.md)
2. **`phase`** - Strategic implementation phase to execute (default: "1")
3. **`tasks`** - Specific task identifiers for surgical implementation (e.g., "T1.1,T1.3")
4. **`branch`** - Git branch for isolated development sanctuary (default: "implementation-phase-{n}")
5. **`testing`** - Quality assurance activation flag (default: false)
6. **`test_command`** - Test execution protocol when quality gates are enabled
7. **`journal`** - Implementation chronicle path (default: `~/.claude/journal/{currentDate}.md`)
8. **`build`** - Project compilation directive (default: false)

Each parameter shapes the implementation trajectory and must be parsed with precision.

**PHASE 2: STRATEGIC CONTEXT RECONNAISSANCE**

Orchestrate parallel intelligence gathering to construct a comprehensive implementation battlefield map:

**Parallel Intelligence Operations:**

**Operation Alpha: Task Analysis**
- Deep parse of tasklist architecture
- Extract selected implementation targets with surgical precision
- Map task dependencies and interconnections
- Identify critical path and parallelization opportunities

**Operation Beta: Project Topology Mapping**
- Execute `eza --tree --git-ignore` for complete structural reconnaissance
- Analyze directory hierarchies and module boundaries
- Identify key integration points and interfaces
- Map the implementation landscape

**Operation Gamma: Standards & Conventions Absorption**
- Ingest `~/.claude/docs/writing-code.md` for coding commandments
- Extract patterns, anti-patterns, and sacred conventions
- Understand the project's coding philosophy
- Prepare style enforcement protocols

**Operation Delta: Dependency Verification**
- Validate all prerequisite tasks are complete
- Check for blocking dependencies
- Ensure environmental readiness
- Verify toolchain availability

**Operation Epsilon: Technology Stack Detection**
- Identify primary languages and frameworks

**Pre-Implementation Quality Gate:**
If `testing === true`:
- Execute full test suite to establish baseline
- Ensure zero failing tests before implementation
- Document current coverage metrics
- Prepare for test-driven implementation

**PHASE 3: SUB-AGENT PROMPT ORCHESTRATION**

Craft a masterful implementation directive that transforms each Sub-Agent into a precision coding instrument:

**PHASE 4: PARALLEL SUB-AGENT DEPLOYMENT & ORCHESTRATION**

**4.1 AGENT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

Orchestrate multiple Sub-Agents for maximum implementation velocity and creative problem-solving diversity:


**Sub-Agent Distribution Strategy:**
- For count 1-5: Launch all agents simultaneously 
- For count 6-20: Launch in batches of 5 agents to manage coordination

**Agent Assignment Protocol:**
Each Sub Agent receives:
1. **Spec Context**: Complete specification file analysis
2. **Directory Snapshot**: Current state of output_dir at launch time
3. **Task Assignment**: Specific Task number (starting_number + agent_index)
4. **Uniqueness Directive**: Explicit instruction to avoid duplicating implementation from existing agents
5. **Quality Standards**: Detailed requirements from the specification and ~/.claude/docs/writing-code.md

**Agent Task Specification:**
```
TASK: implement task [NUMBER] from [SPEC_FILE]

You are Sub Agent [X] completing task [NUMBER]. 

CONTEXT:
- Specification: [Full spec analysis]
- Task Details: [Task description and requirements]
- Assigned creative direction: [Specific innovation dimension to explore]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Read and understand the specification completely
2. Analyze existing iterations to ensure your output is unique
3. Generate content following the spec format exactly
4. Focus on [assigned task] while maintaining spec compliance
5. Create file with exact name pattern specified
6. Ensure your iteration adds genuine value and novelty

DELIVERABLE: Complete task.
```

**Parallel Execution Management:**
- Launch all assigned Sub Agents simultaneously using Task tool
- Monitor agent progress and completion
- Handle any agent failures by reassigning iteration numbers
- Ensure no duplicate iteration numbers are generated
- Collect and validate all completed iterations


**Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol:**
When task count > 5:
- Deploy agents in coordinated waves
- Assign non-overlapping task sets
- Prevent file modification conflicts
- Synchronize through task list updates

**4.2 REAL-TIME MONITORING DASHBOARD**

**Progress Tracking Vectors:**

**Vector Alpha: Task List Evolution**
- Monitor file changes in real-time
- Track task status transitions
- Identify blocked or stalled implementations

**Vector Beta: Git Status Surveillance**  
```bash
watch -n 5 'git status --short'
```
- Track file modifications as they occur
- Detect unexpected changes or conflicts
- Ensure branch isolation integrity

**Vector Gamma: Journal Intelligence Stream**
- Parse journal entries for insights
- Extract time metrics and bottlenecks  
- Identify recurring challenges

**Vector Delta: Test Suite Health** 
{if_testing_enabled:
```bash
watch -n 30 '{test_command}'
```
- Monitor test stability during implementation
- Catch regressions immediately
- Track coverage evolution
}

**4.3 AGENT COORDINATION & CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

**Synchronization Mechanisms:**
- File-level locking through task assignment
- Clear task ownership in tasklist
- Conflict detection through git status
- Rollback protocols for conflicts

**PHASE 5: VERIFICATION, VALIDATION & VICTORY ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION AUDIT**

**Task Completion Verification:**
- Cross-reference all selected tasks against final status
- Validate every task has explicit resolution (complete/blocked/clarification)
- Ensure no phantom or orphaned tasks
- Verify task count integrity

**5.2 IMPLEMENTATION INTEGRITY VALIDATION**

**Code Quality Gates:**
```bash
# Systematic quality verification
eza --tree --git-ignore  # Verify structure intact
git diff --stat         # Quantify changes
git diff --check        # Detect whitespace issues
```

**Standards Compliance Check:**
- Verify coding conventions adherence
- Check for pattern consistency
- Validate naming conventions
- Ensure documentation completeness

**5.3 TEST SUITE EXECUTION & ANALYSIS**
{if_testing_enabled:
```bash
# Full regression suite
{test_command}

# Coverage analysis
{coverage_command if available}

# Performance benchmarks
{benchmark_command if available}
```

**Test Results Analysis:**
- 100% pass rate required
- Coverage must not decrease
- Performance must not degrade
- New tests for new functionality
}

**5.4 CHANGE MANIFEST GENERATION**

```bash
# Comprehensive change analysis
git status --porcelain | wc -l  # Change count
git diff --shortstat            # Line metrics
git diff --name-only            # File list
```
