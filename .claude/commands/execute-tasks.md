This is the start of our agentic coding session.
Read the instructions carefully and follow them closely.
- Check for the tasklist in .claude/tasks folder. Do not start working on the tasks until the user asks you to. This is just for you to get oriented and understand what the focus of our current session is. You are ready to think deeply and complete these tasks.

- Read the task list in .claude/tasks/tasks.md 
- If there is more than one file in .claude/tasks folder, confirm with the user which file to use. Do not assume and make guesses. For any ambiguity, ask the user for clarification.


# Task list
Think deeply and carefully review the task list in the file .claude/tasks/tasks.md. they should be detailed and specific. Each task should be a single line item.
Tasks should be specific and actionable. if a task is complex, break it down into smaller tasks so that they are manageable.
- If a task is ambiguous, ask the user for clarification.
- Use this list to guide your work and ensure that you are completing the tasks in the correct order.
- Update this task list as you complete tasks.
- Do not delete tasks from the list. Instead, mark them as completed by changing the [ ] to [x].
- Do not go out of scope and start working on tasks that are not in the task list. If you think of a new task, that would improve the project, stop and ask the user for confirmation before proceeding. Do not assume that the user wants you to do it.
- Do not get side tracked, remain laser focused on the task list.

Here's an example
```markdown

# Section 1
- [x] Task 1 is an example of a task that is complete
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4
- [ ] Task 5

# Section 2
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4
- [ ] Task 5
