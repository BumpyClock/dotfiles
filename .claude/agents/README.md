---
name: agent-name
description: Detailed description of the agent's purpose and usage
tools: optional-list-of-tools  # Optional field
color: theme-color
---
```

## Usage

Agents are organized in subdirectories by functional area:
- `architecture/` - Architecture and design agents
- `debugging/` - Bug fixing and debugging agents
- `documentation/` - Documentation and content agents
- `Engineering Manager/` - Project management and coordination agents
- `gemini/` - Gemini CLI integration agents
- `prompt-enhancer/` - Prompt optimization agents
- `source-control/` - Version control and Git-related agents
- `specialists/` - Specialized domain experts

## Maintenance

When adding new agents:
1. Follow the standard frontmatter format
2. Assign a color based on the agent's primary function
3. Place the agent in the appropriate subdirectory
4. Update this README if introducing a new color theme
