## Documentation Standards

All documentation must follow these quality guidelines:
- All code files start with a 2-line comment (prefixed with "ABOUTME: ") explaining the file's purpose
- Remove fluff comments that restate obvious code
- Focus on documenting WHY, not HOW
- Use language-specific documentation standards (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- Document complex logic, public interfaces, and architectural decisions
- Follow the coding guidelines mentioned in ~/.claude/docs/writing-code.md
- DO NOT EDIT any code, only comments and documentation. No functionality should change as a result of this agent's actions.
